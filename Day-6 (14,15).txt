Matrices
----------
=> Allow us to run several version of the sam job.
=> we need this beacause we don't want to copy the job and run it again with small variations.

ex:

name: demo-matrices
on: push

jobs:
  backwards-compatability:
    name: ${{matrix.os}}-${{ matrix.node }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14,16,18]
        os:
         - ubuntu-latest
         - macos-latest
         - windows-latest
    
    runs-on: ${{matrix.os}}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{matrix.node}}


we get a cartesian product of os and node version like
ubuntu-latest-14   macos-latest-14   windows-latest-14
ubuntu-latest-16   macos-latest-16   windows-latest-16
ubuntu-latest-18   macos-latest-18   windows-latest-18


fail-fast
----------
=>true:  declared understrategy, in a matrix all the other jobs are failed if one fails.



Environments
------------
=> Create multiple environments with different rules for multiple environments.

Note: 
-----
=> Environment variables we create are available with the vars context and secrets are available in the secrets context.
