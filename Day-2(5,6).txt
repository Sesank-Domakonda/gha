Workflow Runners
-----------------
=> Virtual Server that execute jobs from Workflows

Github hosted -- Windows & ubuntu & mac (steps run on the same VM but the jobs don't)
Self hosted -- Run workflows on any infrastruture of your choice.
               Full control over the VM infrastruture. Can be added at the repo, organization or enterprise level.
               Jobs do not necessarily have to run or clean instance.
              

Actions
--------
=> Custom actions to perform complex, frequently repeadted tasks.
=> It enables great flexibility and reusablility.

=> we can also create our own actions for public/private use.

default key: used to set default values for run settings in all jobs and steps within a workflow.
we can use defaults keyword at the job definition level (sibling to runs-on).
ex:jobs:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
        run: 
          working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app

ex2:
jobs:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  defaults:
    run:
      shell: bash
      working-directory: ./scripts


so every step in the job runs in the specified working directory.

step level

jobs:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Install deps
      run: npm ci
      working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app

=> we can define the workdir ar teh job level also

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults: // this indicates that we can set a default working directory to all the steps in the job.
      run:
        working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app
