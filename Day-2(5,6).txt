Workflow Runners
-----------------
=> Virtual Server that execute jobs from Workflows

Github hosted -- Windows & ubuntu & mac (steps run on the same VM but the jobs don't)
Self hosted -- Run workflows on any infrastruture of your choice.
               Full control over the VM infrastruture. Can be added at the repo, organization or enterprise level.
               Jobs do not necessarily have to run or clean instance.
